'Creating Data For Show'

Barnum is a small application that can be used to create pseudo-realistic data suitable for unit or performance testing.

It was originally created for use in testing [Satchmo](http://www.satchmoproject.com) but should be useful for a bunch of different problem sets.

The easiest way to get started is check out the current source from the svn trunk:
svn checkout http://barnum.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ barnum

Execute python gen\_data.py to see some sample data.
